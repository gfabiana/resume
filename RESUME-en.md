Data Science: How did I get here?

The year was 2018 and I was working on a hair salon. Sometime in the same year, I read something about Artificial Intelligence and became very interested. In "Facebook Developer Circle: SÃ£o Paulo", I saw that there would be an event about AI in the capital. I gathered money and left Campinas towards Hack Station. I didn't understand almost anything there, but I was very excited and motivated to learn. I assimilated better the knowledge acquired at the event and discovered Data Science.

Still at the end of 2018, I signed up for the "DataCamp Machine Learning Track", a 1-year scholarship granted by Facebook. I studied hard to get a good grade in the selection. Well, in Brazil three people were selected and ... I was one of them (the best Christmas present of my life!).

In 2019, I consolidated my desire to work as a Data Scientist, completed my studies at DataCamp, as well as two more courses at Coursera: "Linear Algebra" and "Multivariate Calculus for Machine Learning". In December of the same year, I was able to share my experience with the Facebook team in Latin America (go here to check: https://bit.ly/2wyEPj1).

In 2020, I started my Bachelor's Degree in Data Science, at Univesp.

As expressed on my profile, I'm open to job opportunities, but also to exchange experiences. My email is gvs.fabiana@gmail.com.

Count on me!
